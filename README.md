json-rest-geo-api
=================

Adds the geo data to the JSON API.

The plugin only works in combination with the v1 version of the [WP REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/) plugin. Once it is installed, it will return the geo data of posts if they have been entered based on [this WordPress Codex entry](https://codex.wordpress.org/Geodata). (Most other geo plugins and the official WP mobile apps use that format.)
